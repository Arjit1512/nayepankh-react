          <h3>How it started?</h3>
          <p>
            As we all know 2020 was a year the world was striving to survive
            <br />
            the global pandemic of covid-19. During these dire times we felt an
            <br />
            urge to make an impact with whatever we had; and so we tried!! We
            <br />
            tried to uplift the underprivileged and help the needy with all our
            <br />
            resources and material we could arrange, it was tough but we didn't
            <br />
            lose our hope and kept going in order to bring a change everyone
            <br />
            was expecting the bigger authorities to bring in the societies on
            <br />
            smaller levels. We started off as a group of bunch of highschoolers
            <br />
            but now are a team of numerous people from different parts of the
            <br />
            city and state! 28th March 2021, the day we officially landed on the
            <br />
            ground to serve our duties as the youth of the most rapidly
            <br />
            progressing nation afterall, the main hope of a nation lies in the
            <br />
            arms of its youth.

        <p>
          Nayepankh foundation was initiated to bring a change and help people
          during the tough times of Covid. Later in the year, the NGO started to
          expand their operations
          <br />
          and provide help to a wider section of the society. With this revamped
          vision, the NGO acquired the name of NayePankh - giving wings to uplift
          the underprivileged
          <br />
          section of our society. NayePankh is one of the eminent NGOs espoused in
          providing food, sanitary napkins, clothes, educating underprivileged
          sectors of our
          <br />
          society for the better future. We make efforts to solve daily problems
          faced by people of India. Most of the young women feel humiliating in
          public places during
          <br />
          their menstrual cycle; to bring change we create awareness campaigns
          among woman and youths about personal hygiene, providing sanitary
          napkins. Also, in our
          <br />
          endeavour to fight hunger we distribute food not only to the
          underprivileged community but also to the stray animals. We are also
          providing clothes to the poor
          <br />
          families. Till date we have helped more than two lakhs of people.
          Although this seems quite a big achievement, but our goal is still not
          complete, therefore we're
          <br />
          continuing more with hustle. When lockdown was hitting hard, we took a
          decision and now we are a 124 and 80G certified NGO (that means if
          someone donates to
          <br />
          NayePankh they will get a relief of 50%in income tax). The most striking
          feature about us is that we are completely led by the youths of our
          country, many of whom
          <br />
          are still in their colleges and schools. We are on a mission to make
          this earth a better place to live for all creatures. We are here as
